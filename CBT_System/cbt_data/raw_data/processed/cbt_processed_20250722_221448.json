    "content": "Psychotherapies What is psychotherapy? Psychotherapy (also called talk therapy) refers to a variety of treatments that aim to help a person identify and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. Most psychotherapy takes place one-on-one with a licensed mental health professional or with other patients in a group setting. Psychotherapy and medication are the most common forms of mental health treatment. NIMH has information mental health medications .

Choosing the rightreatment plan is based on a person s individual needs and medical situation and should occur under the guidance of a mental health professional. Even when medication relievesymptoms, psychotherapy can help addresspecific issues. These might include self-defeating ways of thinking; irrational fears; problems interacting with other people; or difficulty coping with situations at home, school, or work. What are thelements of psychotherapy? A variety of psychotherapies have been shown to effectively treat mental health disorders. Often, the type of treatment is tailored to the specific disorder. For example, the treatment approach for someone who has obsessive-compulsive disorder is differenthan the approach for someone who has bipolar disorder. Therapists may use one primary approach or incorporatelements fromultiple approaches depending on their training, the disorder being treated, and the needs of the person receiving treatment. Elements of psychotherapy can include the following: Help a person become aware of automatic ways of thinking that are inaccurate or harmful (for example, having a low opinion of their abilities) and then question those thoughts, understand how the thoughts affectheir emotions and behavior, and change self-defeating behavior patterns. This approach is known as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) . Identify ways to cope with stress andeveloproblem-solving strategies. Examine interactions with others and teach social and communication skills. Apply mindfulness and relaxation techniques, such as meditation and breathing exercises. Usexposure therapy (a type of CBT) for anxiety disorders, in which a person spends brief periods in a supportivenvironment learning tolerate the distress caused by certain items, ideas, or imagined scenes. This continued until, over time, the fear associated withose things goes down. Track emotions and behaviors to raise awareness of their impact on each other. Use supportive counseling to explore troubling issues and receivemotional support. Create a safety plan to help withoughts of self-harm or suicide, recognize warning signs, and use coping strategies, such as contacting friends, family, or emergency personnel. There are many types of psychotherapy. Therapies are often variations of an established approach, such as CBT. There is no formal approval process for psychotherapies like there is for medications by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

    "content": "Mental Health Medications What are mental health medications? Medications can play an important role in treating mental disorders and conditions. They are often used in combination with other treatments, such as psychotherapy and brain stimulation therapy . Medications can affect people in different ways, and it may take several tries to find the medication that works best withe fewest sideffects. It s importanto work with a health care provider or a mental health professional to develop a treatment plan that meets your individual needs and medical situation. Information about medications is updated frequently. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has Medication Guides withe latest information, warnings, and approved medications. MedlinePlus also provides information drugs, herbs, and supplements , including sideffects and warnings. This page provides basic information mental health medications. It is not a complete source for all medications available. It should not be used as a guide when making medical decisions. What are antidepressants? Antidepressants are medications used to treat depression . In some cases, health care providers may prescribe antidepressants to treat other health conditions, such as anxiety , pain , and insomnia . Commonly prescribed types of antidepressants are: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs) These medications are commonly prescribed because they improve the symptoms of a broad group of depressive and anxiety disorders. They are also associated with fewer sideffects than older antidepressants. Although older antidepressants, such as tricyclics and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), are associated with more sideffects, they may be the best option for some people. Antidepressants take time usually 4 8 weeks to work, and problems with sleep, appetite, energy, and concentration often improve before mood lifts. Giving a medication a chance to work is important before deciding whether it is right for you. Common sideffects of SSRIs and other antidepressants include upset stomach, headache, or sexual dysfunction. The sideffects are generally mild and tend to go away with time. People who are sensitive to the sideffects of these medicationsometimes benefit from starting with a low dose, increasing the daily dose very slowly, and changing when or how they take the medication (for example, at bedtime or with food). Esketamine is an FDA-approved medication for treatment-resistant depression, which may be diagnosed when a person symptoms do not improve after trying at leastwo antidepressants. Esketamine is delivered as a nasal spray in a health care provider s office, a clinic, or a hospital. It often acts rapidly, typically within a couple of hours, to relieve depression symptoms. People usually continue to take an oral antidepressanto maintain the improvement in their symptoms. Combining antidepressants with other medications or supplements that act on the serotonin system, such as triptans (often used to treat migraine headaches) and St. John s wort (a dietary supplement), can cause a rare but life-threatening illness called serotonin syndrome . Symptoms of serotonin syndrome include agitation, muscle twitches, hallucinations (seeing or hearing things others do not see or hear), high temperature, and unusual blood pressure changes. For most people, the risk of such extreme reactions is low. It is important for health care providers to consider all possible interactions and usextra care in prescribing and monitoring medication combinations that have an above-average risk. Note : In some cases, children, teenagers, and young adults under 25 may experience an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants, especially in the first feweeks after starting the medication or when the dose is changed. People of all ages taking antidepressantshould be watched closely, especially during the first feweeks of treatment. If you or someone you know istruggling or having thoughts of suicide, call or texthe 988 Suicide   Crisis Lifeline at 988 or chat 988lifeline.org . In life-threatening situations, call 911 . What are anti-anxiety medications? Anti-anxiety medications help reduce symptoms of anxiety , such as panic attacks and extreme fear and worry. Many medications used to treat depression including SSRIs and SNRIs may also be used to treat anxiety. In the case of panic disorder or social anxiety disorder , health care providers typically start with SSRIs or other antidepressants as the initial treatment because they have fewer sideffects than other medications. Benzodiazepines are another common type of anti-anxiety medication used to treat some short-term anxiety symptoms. They are sometimes used to treat generalized anxiety disorder . Health care providers may also prescribeta-blockers off-label to treat short-term anxiety symptoms, even though the medication is not approved for that specific purpose. For instance, people with a phobian overwhelming and unreasonable fear of an object or situation like spiders or public speaking often experience intense physical symptoms, such as rapid heart rate, sweating, and tremors. Beta-blockers can help manage these symptoms. Benzodiazepines and beta-blockers are useful as needed to reduce severe anxiety in the short-term. However, taking benzodiazepines over long periods may lead to drug tolerance or even dependence. To avoid these problems, health care providers usually prescribenzodiazepines for short periods and taper them slowly to reduce the likelihood of withdrawal symptoms orenewed anxiety symptoms. Beta-blockers generally are not recommended for people with asthma or diabetes because they may worsen the symptoms of both conditions. Buspirone is a differentype of anti-anxiety medication that can be used to treat anxiety over longer periods. In contrasto benzodiazepines, buspirone must be taken every day for 3 4 weeks to reach its full effect, and it is not effective for treating anxiety on an as-needed basis. What are stimulants? Health care providers may prescribe stimulant medications to treattention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy . Stimulants increase alertness, attention, and energy. They can also elevate blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing. Prescription stimulants improve alertness and focus for most people, regardless of diagnosis. These medications can markedly improve daily functioning for people with significant focus problems, such as people with ADHD. Although motor hyperactivity associated with ADHD in children usually goes away by the time they reach adolescence, people with ADHD may continue to experience inattention and have difficulty focusing into adulthood. Asuch, stimulant medications can be helpful for adults, as well as for children and adolescents, with ADHD. Stimulants are safe when taken under a health care provider supervision and used as directed. Some children may report feeling slightly different or unlike their usual selves while taking the medication. Most sideffects of stimulants are minor and not seen at low doses. Some parents worry that stimulants may lead to misuse or dependence, but evidence shows this unlikely when the medications are used as prescribed. Other challenges with stimulantreatment, such asleep disturbance and slowed growth, can generally be safely managed by a health care provider. What are antipsychotics? Antipsychotic medications are typically used to treat psychosis , a condition that involvesome loss of contact with reality. Peoplexperiencing a psychotic episode often experience delusions (false beliefs) or hallucinations. Psychosis can be related to drug use or a mental disorder such aschizophrenia , bipolar disorder , or severe depression (also known as psychotic depression). Health care providers may also prescribe antipsychotics in combination with other medications to relieve symptoms of delirium , dementia , or other mental health conditions that are more common in older adults. The FDA requires that all antipsychotics include a black box warning stating thathe medications are associated with increased rates of stroke andeath in older adults with dementia. Older, first-generation antipsychotic medications are sometimes called typical antipsychotics (or neuroleptics). Long-term use of typical antipsychotics may lead to a condition involving uncontrollable muscle movements called tardive dyskinesia , which can range fromild to severe. People who think they might have tardive dyskinesia should check with a health care provider before stopping their medication. Newer, second-generation medications are sometimes called atypical antipsychotics. Several atypical antipsychotics are available. They are commonly used because they treat a broaderange of symptoms compared with older medications. For example, atypical antipsychotics are sometimes used to treat bipolar depression or depression in people that have not responded to antidepressant medication alone. Health care providers may ask people taking atypical antipsychotics to participate in regular monitoring of weight, glucose levels, and lipid levels. Some symptoms, such as agitation and hallucinations, typically go away within days of starting antipsychotic medication. Other symptoms, such as delusions, usually go away within a feweeks. However, people may not experience the full effects of antipsychotic medication for up to 6 weeks. If a person symptoms do not improve with usual antipsychotic medications, they may be prescribed an atypical antipsychoticalled clozapine . People who take clozapine must have regular blood tests to check for a potentially dangerousideffecthat occurs in 1  2  of people. What are mood stabilizers? Mood stabilizers are typically used to treat bipolar disorder and mood changes associated with other mental disorders. In some cases, health care providers may prescribe mood stabilizers to augmentheffect of other medications used to treat depression. Lithium , an effective mood stabilizer, is approved for the treatment of maniand bipolar disorder. Some studies indicate that lithiumay reduce the risk of suicide among people taking it for long-term symptomaintenance. Health care providers generally ask people who are taking lithium to participate in regular monitoring to check lithium levels and kidney and thyroid function. Mood stabilizers are sometimes used to treat depression (usually along with antidepressant), schizoaffective disorder, disorders of impulse control, and certain mental illnesses in children. For people with bipolar depression, health care providers typically prescribe a mood stabilizer and antidepressanto reduce the risk of switching into mania (known as rapid cycling). Some anticonvulsant medications may also be used as mood stabilizers, as they work better than lithium for certain people, such as people with  mixed  symptoms of maniandepression or those with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder. Health care providers generally ask people taking anticonvulsants to participate in regular monitoring to check medication levels and assessideffects and potential interactions with other common medications. What should I know about mental health medications? People respond to medications in different ways, and it may take several tries to find the medication that is most effective withe fewest sideffects. In some cases, people find that a medication helps for a while and then their symptoms return. It often takesome time for a medication to work, so it is importanto stick withe treatment pland take medication as prescribed. People should not stop taking a prescribed medication, even if they are feeling better, withouthelp of a health care provider. A provider can adjusthe treatment plan to slowly and safely decrease the medication dose. It s importanto give the body time to adjusto the change. Stopping a medication too soon may cause unpleasant or harmful sideffects. If you are prescribed a medication: Tell a health care provider about all other medications, vitamins, and supplements you are already taking. Remind a health care provider about any allergies. Tell them about any problems you had with medications in the past. Make sure younderstand how to take the medication before you start using it, and take the medication as instructed. Talk to a health care provider about possible sideffects and whato expect when taking a medication. Do notake medications prescribed for another person. Do not give your prescribed medication to someonelse. Call a health care provideright away if you have problems with your medication or are worried that it might be doing more harm than good. The provider will work with you to address the problems andeterminext steps. Report seriousideffects to the FDA MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting Program . How do I contact FDA MedWatch?

Statistics Information abouthe prevalence and treatment of anxiety disorders in the United States. Why is NIMH studying anxiety disorders? About a third of U.S. adolescents and adults experience anxiety disorder at some point in their lives. Anxiety disorder symptoms can interfere with daily life and routine activities, such as job performance, schoolwork, and relationships. In severe cases, a person might feel intense fear in common situations, avoid social encounters, orefuse to leave their home. How is NIMH research addressing this critical topic? NIMH conducts and funds research to examinenvironmental and genetic factors that contribute to anxiety disorders. These include studies comparing brain development and biology among people with and without anxiety disorders. Our supported research also focuses on family and other environmental factors that may influence the risk for anxiety disorders infants, children, adolescents, and adults. NIMH-supported research is examining rates and symptoms of anxiety disorders after major lifevents like pregnancy or after trauma or illness. Of particular interest are predictors and symptoms of anxiety disorders among youth, including during the college transition and in relation to social media use. Additionally, NIMH supports research on interventions and treatments for differentypes of anxiety disorders.

    "content": "Technology and the Future of Mental Health Treatment How is technology used for mental health treatment? Technology has opened a new frontier in mental health care andata collection. Mobile devices like cell phones, smartphones, and tablets are giving the public, health care providers, and researchers neways to access help, monitor progress, and increase understanding of mental well-being. Mobile mental health support can be very simple but effective. For example, anyone with a phone or computer can call, text, or chathe 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at any time. New technology can also be packaged into an extremely sophisticated app for smartphones or tablets. Such apps might use the device s built-in sensors to collect information a user s typical behavior patterns. Then, if the app detects a change in behavior, it can signal that help is needed before a crisis occurs. Some apps are stand-alone programs designed to improve memory or thinking skills. Other apps helpeople connecto a peer counselor a health care professional. Excitement abouthe huge range of opportunities technology offers for mental health treatment has led to a burst of development. Thousands of mental health apps are available in iTunes and Android app stores, and the number is growing everyear. However, this new technology frontier includes a lot of uncertainty. There is very little industry regulation and very little information app effectiveness, which can lead people to wonder which apps they should trust. Before focusing on the state of the science and where it may lead, it s importanto look athe advantages andisadvantages of expanding mental health treatment and research into a mobile world. What are the pros and cons of mental health apps? Mental health apps and other technology have a lot of potential, both for people seeking mental health care and mental health professionals providing such services. Some advantages of mobile care technology include the following. Convenience : Allows treatmento take place anytime and anywhere, such as at home in the middle of the night or on a bus on the way to work, making it ideal for people who have trouble getting to in-person appointments Anonymity : Lets people receive treatment anonymously and privately from the comfort of their homes Introduction to care : Acts as a good firstep for people who have been reluctanto seek mental health care in the past Lower cost : Makes care more affordable through apps that are free or cheaper than traditional in-person care Greater outreach : Helps mental health professionals offer treatmento people in remote areas or to large numbers of people in times of suddeneed, like after a natural disaster or traumatic event Interest : Encourages people to continue therapy by making care more appealing and accessible than traditional in-person treatment 24-hour service : Provides around-the-clock monitoring or intervention support Consistency : Offers the same treatment program to all people Support : Complements traditional therapy by extending in-person sessions, reinforcing new skills, and providing support and monitoring Data collection : Collects information, such as location, movement, phone use, and other data Mental health technology offers great opportunities but also raises concerns. Addressing potential problems will bessential to ensuring that new apps provide benefits without causing harm. Although apps are becoming more appealing and user-friendly, we need more information their effectiveness. The following are some limitations of the technology that researchers andevelopers are trying to answer questions about. Effectiveness : Is the app supported by scientific evidence showing that it works and works as well as traditional in-person methods? Audience : Does the app work equally well for all people it is meanto help? Privacy : How does the app maker guarantee users  privacy, considering many apps deal with sensitive personal information? Guidance : How do people determine if an app is effective wheno industry-wide standards exist for evaluating quality? Regulation : Who should regulate mental health technology and the data it generates? Overselling : Does the appromise more than it delivers and turn people away from using other, moreffective therapies? What are currentrends in app development? Research and engineering teams are combining their skills to address a wide range of mental health concerns. For instance, intervention apps may helpeople quit smoking; manage symptoms of anxiety, depression, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress, or insomnia; and more. Some populareas of app development include the following. Self-management Self-management apps involve people putting information into the app to receive feedback. For example, they might use the app to set medication reminders or access tools for managing stress, anxiety, or sleeproblems. Some software can use additional equipmento track heart rate, breathing patterns, blood pressure, and so forth to helpeople monitor their progress and receive feedback. Improve thinking skills Cognitive remediation apps helpeople improve their thinking skills. These apps are often designed for people with serious mental illnesses who may have distorted or unhelpful ways of thinking or hold inaccurate beliefs. Skill training Skill training apps may feel more like games than other mental health apps as they helpeoplearnew coping or thinking skills. These apps might involve watching an educational video about anxiety management or the importance of social support, for example. People then pick new strategies to try and use the app to track how often they practice those new skills. Illness management and supported care Illness management and supported care apps provide additional support by allowing people to interact with another person. The app may connect people with peer support or send information to a trained health care provider who can offer guidance and therapy options. Researchers are working to learn how muchuman interaction people need for app-based treatments to beffective. Passive symptom tracking Symptom tracking apps collect data using the sensors built into smartphones. The sensors might record movement patterns, social interactions (such as the number of texts and phone calls), behavior at differentimes of day, vocal tone and speed, and more. In the future, apps may be able to analyze these data to determine a person s real-time state of mind. Such apps may also recognize changes in behavior patterns that signal an episode of mania, depression, or psychosis before it occurs. Although an app may not replace a mental health professional, it can alert caregivers when someoneeds additional help. The goal is to create apps that support a range of people, including those with serious mental illnesses. Data collection Data collection apps gather data without any help from the person using them. Receiving widescale information fromany people athe same time can increase researchers  understanding of mental health and help them develop better interventions. Conducting research Apps can help conduct research. For example, Dr. Patricia Areán s pioneering BRIGTHEN study showed that research via smartphone app is a reality. The BRIGHTEN study was remarkable because it used technology to both deliver treatment and conduct research. In other words, the research team used technology to recruit, screen, enroll, treat, and assess participants. BRIGHTEN was especially exciting because the study showed thatechnology can be an efficient way to test promising new treatments, while also highlighting the need to make those treatments engaging. If you or someone you know istruggling or having thoughts of suicide, call or texthe 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 or chat 988lifeline.org . In life-threatening situations, call 911 . Who creates mental health apps? Developing mental health apps and other technology requires a partnership between mental health professionals and softwarengineers. Researchers have found that interventions are most effective when people like them, arengaged in them, and wanto continue using them. Behavioral health apps work best when they combinengineerskills for making an app easy to use and entertaining with providerskills for providing effective treatment options. Researchers and engineers are developing and testing apps that do everything fromanage medications to teach coping skills to predict when someone may need emotional help. Who evaluates mental health apps? There are no review boards, checklists, or widely accepted rules for evaluating or choosing a mental health app or other technology. Most apps do not have peer-reviewed research to supportheir claims, and it is unlikely that every mental health app will go through a randomized clinical research trial to test its effectiveness. One reason is thatesting is a slow process, and technology evolves quickly. By the time an app has been puthrough rigorouscientific testing, the original technology may be outdated. Currently, there are no national standards for evaluating theffectiveness of the hundreds of available mental health apps. People should be cautious aboutrusting an app. However, there are a few suggestions for finding an app that may work for you: Ask a trusted health care provider for a recommendation. Some larger providers may offer several apps and collect data on their use. Check to see if the app offers recommendations for whato do if symptoms get worse or there is a psychiatric emergency. Know how to get help if needed. Decide if you want an app that is completely automated versus an app that offers opportunities for contact with a trained professional. Search for information the app developer, including their credentials and experience. Beware of misleading logos. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has not developed andoes not endorse any apps. However, some app developers have unlawfully used the NIMH logo to marketheir products. Search the PubMedatabase offered by the National Library of Medicine. This resource contains articles on a wide range of research topics, including mental health app development. If you cannot find information about a particular app, check to see if the app is based on a treatmenthat has been tested. For example, researchashown that internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is as effective as conventional CBT for disorders that includepression, anxiety, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. Try it. If you re interested in an app, test it for a few days andecide if it s easy to use, holds your attention, and isomething you wanto continue using. An app is only effective if it keeps you engaged. What is NIMH s role in research on mental health intervention technology? NIMH has awarded over 400 grants for technology-enhanced mental health interventions. NIMH staff continue to actively review and evaluate research grants related to mental health technology. These grants have focused on many areas, including: Feasibility, efficacy, and effectiveness research, such as developing and refining new treatments and interventions Technology for addressing a wide range of mental disorders, such aschizophrenia, HIV, depression, anxiety, autism, suicide, eating disorders, and trauma Interventions for cognitive issues, illness management, problematic behavior, and health communication More accessible and engaging ways to deliver therapies or skill development (for example, interactive formats or game-like approaches) and apps that work on any device Incorporating real-time, face-to-face contact oremote counseling (phone or online) with peers and professionals to provide a balance between technology and human touch Active and passive mobile assessment and monitoring Artificial intelligence (AI) tools and technologies A significant portion of NIMH funding for these types of technologies is through the NIMH Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Programs . In addition, NIMH created the National Advisory Mental Health Council workgroup on Opportunities and Challenges of Developing Information Technologies on Behavioral and Social Science Clinical Research to track and guide this rapidly changing area. In 2017, the workgroup released a report reviewing the opportunities for and challenges of using new information technologies to study human behaviors relevanto the NIMH mission. NIMH voiced its interest in this research area in a 2022 notice of special interest . The notice called foresearch on the utility and validity of digital health and AI tools and technologies in epidemiological, clinical, and intervention research. How can I find a clinical trial on mental health intervention technology? Clinical trials aresearch studies that look at neways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and conditions. The goal of a clinical trial is to determine if a new test or treatment works and isafe. Although people may benefit from being part of a clinical trial, they should know thathe primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gainew scientific knowledge so that others may better helped in the future. Researchers at NIMH and around the country conduct many studies with patients and healthy volunteers. We have new and better treatment options today because of what clinical trials have uncovered. Be part of tomorrow s medical breakthroughs. Talk to a health care provider about clinical trials, their benefits and risks, and whether one is right for you.
