    "content": "Psychotherapies What is psychotherapy ? Psychotherapy (also called talk therapy) refers to a variety of treatments that aim to help a person identify and change troubling emotions , thoughts , and behaviors . Most psychotherapy takes place one-on-one with a licensed mental health professional or with other patients in a group setting . Psychotherapy and medication are the most common forms of mental health treatment . NIMH has information on mental health medications . In general , the goals of psychotherapy are to gain relief from symptoms , maintain or enhance daily functioning , and improve quality of life . You or someone you know might seek out psychotherapy for many reasons , including : Dealing with severe or long-term stress from a job or family situation , the loss of a loved one , or relationship or family problems Having symptoms with no physical explanation , such as changes in sleep or appetite , low energy , lack of interest or pleasure in activities you once enjoyed , persistent irritability , excessive worry , or a sense of discouragement or hopelessness that won t go away A health care provider suspecting you have or diagnosing you with a mental disorder that is interfering with your life Supporting a child or family member who has been diagnosed with a condition affecting their mental health First being examined by a health care provider can help rule out a physical health issue . This step is important because sometimes symptoms , like a change in mood or trouble concentrating , are due to a medical condition . Psychotherapy and other treatment options Psychotherapy can be used as an alternative to or alongside medication and other treatment options . Choosing the right treatment plan is based on a person s individual needs and medical situation and should occur under the guidance of a mental health professional . Even when medication relieves symptoms , psychotherapy can help address specific issues . These might include self-defeating ways of thinking ; irrational fears ; problems interacting with other people ; or difficulty coping with situations at home , school , or work . What are the elements of psychotherapy ? A variety of psychotherapies have been shown to effectively treat mental health disorders . Often , the type of treatment is tailored to the specific disorder . For example , the treatment approach for someone who has obsessive-compulsive disorder is different than the approach for someone who has bipolar disorder . Therapists may use one primary approach or incorporate elements from multiple approaches depending on their training , the disorder being treated , and the needs of the person receiving treatment . Elements of psychotherapy can include the following : Help a person become aware of automatic ways of thinking that are inaccurate or harmful (for example , having a low opinion of their abilities) and then question those thoughts , understand how the thoughts affect their emotions and behavior , and change self-defeating behavior patterns . This approach is known as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) . Identify ways to cope with stress and develop problem-solving strategies . Examine interactions with others and teach social and communication skills . Apply mindfulness and relaxation techniques , such as meditation and breathing exercises . Use exposure therapy (a type of CBT) for anxiety disorders , in which a person spends brief periods in a supportive environment learning to tolerate the distress caused by certain items , ideas , or imagined scenes . This is continued until , over time , the fear associated with those things goes down . Track emotions and behaviors to raise awareness of their impact on each other . Use supportive counseling to explore troubling issues and receive emotional support . Create a safety plan to help with thoughts of self-harm or suicide , recognize warning signs , and use coping strategies , such as contacting friends , family , or emergency personnel . There are many types of psychotherapy . Therapies are often variations of an established approach , such as CBT . There is no formal approval process for psychotherapies like there is for medications by the U . S . Food and Drug Administration . However , for many therapies , research involving large numbers of patients has provided evidence that the treatment is effective . These evidence-based therapies have been shown to reduce symptoms of depression , anxiety , and other mental disorders . NIMH s health topic pages list some of the evidence-based therapies used to treat specific disorders . What should I look for in a therapist ? Therapists have different professional backgrounds and specialties . The approach a therapist uses depends on their training and experience and the disorder being treated . This section and the next provide information that can help you find a therapist s credentials and resources for locating therapists . Once you have identified one or more possible therapists , a preliminary conversation can help you understand how treatment will proceed and if you feel comfortable with the therapist . Rapport and trust are essential . Discussions in therapy are deeply personal , and it s important that you feel comfortable with the therapist and have confidence in their expertise . These preliminary conversations may happen in person , by phone , or virtually . Consider asking the following questions : What are the credentials and experience of the therapist ? Does the therapist have a specialty ? What approach will the therapist use to help you ? Do they practice a particular type of therapy ? What is the rationale for the therapy and its evidence base ? Does the therapist have experience in diagnosing and treating the age group (for example , a child) and the specific condition ? If the patient is a child , how will parents or caregivers be involved in treatment ? What are the goals of therapy ? Does the therapist recommend a specific time frame or number of sessions ? How will progress be assessed ? What happens if you (or the therapist) feel you aren t starting to improve ? Are medications an option ? Is this therapist able to prescribe medications ? Are meetings confidential ? How is confidentiality assured ? Are there limits to confidentiality ? If you have been in therapy for what feels like a reasonable amount of time and are not getting better , talk to your therapist . You might want to explore other mental health professionals or approaches . How can I find a therapist ? Many types of professionals offer psychotherapy . Examples include psychiatrists , psychologists , social workers , counselors , and psychiatric nurses . Information on providers credentials is available from the National Alliance on Mental Illness and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration . NIMH has information on ways to get help , find a health care provider , and access treatment , including reduced-cost health services . Your health insurance provider may also have a list of specific mental health professionals participating in your plan . When talking with a prospective therapist , ask about treatment fees , whether the therapist accepts insurance , and whether there is a sliding scale for fees according to income . The following professional organizations have directories or locators on their websites for finding mental health professionals : Academy of Cognitive and Behavioral Therapies American Academy of Child Adolescent Psychiatry American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy American Board of Clinical Social Work American Board of Professional Psychology American Psychiatric Association American Psychological Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies National Association of Social Workers National Register of Health Service Psychologists Psychology Today Society of Clinical Psychology National advocacy organizations provide information on finding mental health professionals , and some have locators for finding a therapist on their websites . Examples include : Anxiety Depression Association of America Attention Deficit Disorder Association Children and Adults With Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance International OCD Foundation Mental Health America National Alliance on Mental Illness Note : NIMH does not evaluate the professional qualifications and competencies of individual practitioners listed on these websites . These resources are provided for informational purposes only . They are not comprehensive lists , and an organization s inclusion does not constitute an endorsement by NIMH , the National Institutes of Health , the U . S . Department of Health and Human Services , or the U . S . government . Many universities or medical schools have affiliated programs that offer treatment options , including training clinics . You can find these programs by searching the website of local university health centers for their psychiatry or psychology departments . You can also go to the website for the health department in your state or county to look for mental health-related programs they might offer . What are options for digital health care ? The telephone , the internet , and mobile devices have created new opportunities for readily available and accessible treatment , including in areas where mental health professionals may not be physically available . Some of these approaches involve a therapist providing help at a distance . Others , such as web-based programs and mobile apps , are designed to provide immediate information and feedback in the absence of a therapist .

    "content": "Mental Health Medications What are mental health medications ? Medications can play an important role in treating mental disorders and conditions . They are often used in combination with other treatments , such as psychotherapy and brain stimulation therapy . Medications can affect people in different ways , and it may take several tries to find the medication that works best with the fewest side effects . It s important to work with a health care provider or a mental health professional to develop a treatment plan that meets your individual needs and medical situation . Information about medications is updated frequently . The U . S . Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has Medication Guides with the latest information , warnings , and approved medications . MedlinePlus also provides information on drugs , herbs , and supplements , including side effects and warnings . This page provides basic information on mental health medications . It is not a complete source for all medications available . It should not be used as a guide when making medical decisions . What are antidepressants ? Antidepressants are medications used to treat depression . In some cases , health care providers may prescribe antidepressants to treat other health conditions , such as anxiety , pain , and insomnia . Commonly prescribed types of antidepressants are : Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs) These medications are commonly prescribed because they improve the symptoms of a broad group of depressive and anxiety disorders . They are also associated with fewer side effects than older antidepressants . Although older antidepressants , such as tricyclics and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), are associated with more side effects , they may be the best option for some people . Antidepressants take time usually 4 8 weeks to work , and problems with sleep , appetite , energy , and concentration often improve before mood lifts . Giving a medication a chance to work is important before deciding whether it is right for you . Common side effects of SSRIs and other antidepressants include upset stomach , headache , or sexual dysfunction . The side effects are generally mild and tend to go away with time . People who are sensitive to the side effects of these medications sometimes benefit from starting with a low dose , increasing the daily dose very slowly , and changing when or how they take the medication (for example , at bedtime or with food). Esketamine is an FDA-approved medication for treatment-resistant depression , which may be diagnosed when a person s symptoms do not improve after trying at least two antidepressants . Esketamine is delivered as a nasal spray in a health care provider s office , a clinic , or a hospital . It often acts rapidly , typically within a couple of hours , to relieve depression symptoms . People usually continue to take an oral antidepressant to maintain the improvement in their symptoms . Combining antidepressants with other medications or supplements that act on the serotonin system , such as triptans (often used to treat migraine headaches) and St . John s wort (a dietary supplement), can cause a rare but life-threatening illness called serotonin syndrome . Symptoms of serotonin syndrome include agitation , muscle twitches , hallucinations (seeing or hearing things others do not see or hear), high temperature , and unusual blood pressure changes . For most people , the risk of such extreme reactions is low . It is important for health care providers to consider all possible interactions and use extra care in prescribing and monitoring medication combinations that have an above-average risk . Note : In some cases , children , teenagers , and young adults under 25 may experience an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants , especially in the first few weeks after starting the medication or when the dose is changed . People of all ages taking antidepressants should be watched closely , especially during the first few weeks of treatment . If you or someone you know is struggling or having thoughts of suicide , call or text the 988 Suicide Crisis Lifeline at 988 or chat at 988lifeline . org . In life-threatening situations , call 911 . What are anti-anxiety medications ? Anti-anxiety medications help reduce symptoms of anxiety , such as panic attacks and extreme fear and worry . Many medications used to treat depression including SSRIs and SNRIs may also be used to treat anxiety . In the case of panic disorder or social anxiety disorder , health care providers typically start with SSRIs or other antidepressants as the initial treatment because they have fewer side effects than other medications . Benzodiazepines are another common type of anti-anxiety medication used to treat some short-term anxiety symptoms . They are sometimes used to treat generalized anxiety disorder . Health care providers may also prescribe beta-blockers off-label to treat short-term anxiety symptoms , even though the medication is not approved for that specific purpose . For instance , people with a phobia an overwhelming and unreasonable fear of an object or situation like spiders or public speaking often experience intense physical symptoms , such as rapid heart rate , sweating , and tremors . Beta-blockers can help manage these symptoms . Benzodiazepines and beta-blockers are useful as needed to reduce severe anxiety in the short-term . However , taking benzodiazepines over long periods may lead to drug tolerance or even dependence . To avoid these problems , health care providers usually prescribe benzodiazepines for short periods and taper them slowly to reduce the likelihood of withdrawal symptoms or renewed anxiety symptoms . Beta-blockers generally are not recommended for people with asthma or diabetes because they may worsen the symptoms of both conditions . Buspirone is a different type of anti-anxiety medication that can be used to treat anxiety over longer periods . In contrast to benzodiazepines , buspirone must be taken every day for 3 4 weeks to reach its full effect , and it is not effective for treating anxiety on an as-needed basis . What are stimulants ? Health care providers may prescribe stimulant medications to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy . Stimulants increase alertness , attention , and energy . They can also elevate blood pressure , heart rate , and breathing . Prescription stimulants improve alertness and focus for most people , regardless of diagnosis . These medications can markedly improve daily functioning for people with significant focus problems , such as people with ADHD . Although motor hyperactivity associated with ADHD in children usually goes away by the time they reach adolescence , people with ADHD may continue to experience inattention and have difficulty focusing into adulthood . As such , stimulant medications can be helpful for adults , as well as for children and adolescents , with ADHD . Stimulants are safe when taken under a health care provider s supervision and used as directed . Some children may report feeling slightly different or unlike their usual selves while taking the medication . Most side effects of stimulants are minor and not seen at low doses . Some parents worry that stimulants may lead to misuse or dependence , but evidence shows this is unlikely when the medications are used as prescribed . Other challenges with stimulant treatment , such as sleep disturbance and slowed growth , can generally be safely managed by a health care provider . What are antipsychotics ? Antipsychotic medications are typically used to treat psychosis , a condition that involves some loss of contact with reality . People experiencing a psychotic episode often experience delusions (false beliefs) or hallucinations . Psychosis can be related to drug use or a mental disorder such as schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , or severe depression (also known as psychotic depression). Health care providers may also prescribe antipsychotics in combination with other medications to relieve symptoms of delirium , dementia , or other mental health conditions that are more common in older adults . The FDA requires that all antipsychotics include a black box warning stating that the medications are associated with increased rates of stroke and death in older adults with dementia . Older , first-generation antipsychotic medications are sometimes called typical antipsychotics (or neuroleptics). Long-term use of typical antipsychotics may lead to a condition involving uncontrollable muscle movements called tardive dyskinesia , which can range from mild to severe . People who think they might have tardive dyskinesia should check with a health care provider before stopping their medication . Newer , second-generation medications are sometimes called atypical antipsychotics . Several atypical antipsychotics are available . They are commonly used because they treat a broader range of symptoms compared with older medications . For example , atypical antipsychotics are sometimes used to treat bipolar depression or depression in people that have not responded to antidepressant medication alone . Health care providers may ask people taking atypical antipsychotics to participate in regular monitoring of weight , glucose levels , and lipid levels . Some symptoms , such as agitation and hallucinations , typically go away within days of starting antipsychotic medication . Other symptoms , such as delusions , usually go away within a few weeks . However , people may not experience the full effects of antipsychotic medication for up to 6 weeks . If a person s symptoms do not improve with usual antipsychotic medications , they may be prescribed an atypical antipsychotic called clozapine . People who take clozapine must have regular blood tests to check for a potentially dangerous side effect that occurs in 1 2 of people . What are mood stabilizers ? Mood stabilizers are typically used to treat bipolar disorder and mood changes associated with other mental disorders . In some cases , health care providers may prescribe mood stabilizers to augment the effect of other medications used to treat depression . Lithium , an effective mood stabilizer , is approved for the treatment of mania and bipolar disorder . Some studies indicate that lithium may reduce the risk of suicide among people taking it for long-term symptom maintenance . Health care providers generally ask people who are taking lithium to participate in regular monitoring to check lithium levels and kidney and thyroid function . Mood stabilizers are sometimes used to treat depression (usually along with an antidepressant), schizoaffective disorder , disorders of impulse control , and certain mental illnesses in children . For people with bipolar depression , health care providers typically prescribe a mood stabilizer and an antidepressant to reduce the risk of switching into mania (known as rapid cycling). Some anticonvulsant medications may also be used as mood stabilizers , as they work better than lithium for certain people , such as people with mixed symptoms of mania and depression or those with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder . Health care providers generally ask people taking anticonvulsants to participate in regular monitoring to check medication levels and assess side effects and potential interactions with other common medications . What should I know about mental health medications ? People respond to medications in different ways , and it may take several tries to find the medication that is most effective with the fewest side effects . In some cases , people find that a medication helps for a while and then their symptoms return . It often takes some time for a medication to work , so it is important to stick with the treatment plan and take medication as prescribed . People should not stop taking a prescribed medication , even if they are feeling better , without the help of a health care provider . A provider can adjust the treatment plan to slowly and safely decrease the medication dose . It s important to give the body time to adjust to the change . Stopping a medication too soon may cause unpleasant or harmful side effects . If you are prescribed a medication : Tell a health care provider about all other medications , vitamins , and supplements you are already taking . Remind a health care provider about any allergies . Tell them about any problems you had with medications in the past . Make sure you understand how to take the medication before you start using it , and take the medication as instructed . Talk to a health care provider about possible side effects and what to expect when taking a medication . Do not take medications prescribed for another person . Do not give your prescribed medication to someone else . Call a health care provider right away if you have problems with your medication or are worried that it might be doing more harm than good . The provider will work with you to address the problems and determine next steps . Report serious side effects to the FDA MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting Program . How do I contact FDA MedWatch ? The FDA is responsible for protecting public health by ensuring the safety , efficacy , and security of medications , biological products , and medical devices . Contact FDA MedWatch to voluntarily report a : Serious adverse effect Product quality problem Product use error Product failure that you suspect is associated with an FDA-regulated drug , biologic , medical device , dietary supplement , or cosmetic You or a health care provider can make a report online or by calling 1-800-332-1088.

    "content": "Technology and the Future of Mental Health Treatment How is technology used for mental health treatment ? Technology has opened a new frontier in mental health care and data collection . Mobile devices like cell phones , smartphones , and tablets are giving the public , health care providers , and researchers new ways to access help , monitor progress , and increase understanding of mental well-being . Mobile mental health support can be very simple but effective . For example , anyone with a phone or computer can call , text , or chat the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at any time . New technology can also be packaged into an extremely sophisticated app for smartphones or tablets . Such apps might use the device s built-in sensors to collect information on a user s typical behavior patterns . Then , if the app detects a change in behavior , it can signal that help is needed before a crisis occurs . Some apps are stand-alone programs designed to improve memory or thinking skills . Other apps help people connect to a peer counselor or a health care professional . Excitement about the huge range of opportunities technology offers for mental health treatment has led to a burst of development . Thousands of mental health apps are available in iTunes and Android app stores , and the number is growing every year . However , this new technology frontier includes a lot of uncertainty . There is very little industry regulation and very little information on app effectiveness , which can lead people to wonder which apps they should trust . Before focusing on the state of the science and where it may lead , it s important to look at the advantages and disadvantages of expanding mental health treatment and research into a mobile world . What are the pros and cons of mental health apps ? Mental health apps and other technology have a lot of potential , both for people seeking mental health care and mental health professionals providing such services . Some advantages of mobile care technology include the following . Convenience : Allows treatment to take place anytime and anywhere , such as at home in the middle of the night or on a bus on the way to work , making it ideal for people who have trouble getting to in-person appointments Anonymity : Lets people receive treatment anonymously and privately from the comfort of their homes Introduction to care : Acts as a good first step for people who have been reluctant to seek mental health care in the past Lower cost : Makes care more affordable through apps that are free or cheaper than traditional in-person care Greater outreach : Helps mental health professionals offer treatment to people in remote areas or to large numbers of people in times of sudden need , like after a natural disaster or traumatic event Interest : Encourages people to continue therapy by making care more appealing and accessible than traditional in-person treatment 24-hour service : Provides around-the-clock monitoring or intervention support Consistency : Offers the same treatment program to all people Support : Complements traditional therapy by extending in-person sessions , reinforcing new skills , and providing support and monitoring Data collection : Collects information , such as location , movement , phone use , and other data Mental health technology offers great opportunities but also raises concerns . Addressing potential problems will be essential to ensuring that new apps provide benefits without causing harm . Although apps are becoming more appealing and user-friendly , we need more information on their effectiveness . The following are some limitations of the technology that researchers and developers are trying to answer questions about . Effectiveness : Is the app supported by scientific evidence showing that it works and works as well as traditional in-person methods ? Audience : Does the app work equally well for all people it is meant to help ? Privacy : How does the app maker guarantee users privacy , considering many apps deal with sensitive personal information ? Guidance : How do people determine if an app is effective when no industry-wide standards exist for evaluating quality ? Regulation : Who should regulate mental health technology and the data it generates ? Overselling : Does the app promise more than it delivers and turn people away from using other , more effective therapies ? What are current trends in app development ? Research and engineering teams are combining their skills to address a wide range of mental health concerns . For instance , intervention apps may help people quit smoking ; manage symptoms of anxiety , depression , eating disorders , post-traumatic stress , or insomnia ; and more . Some popular areas of app development include the following . Self-management Self-management apps involve people putting information into the app to receive feedback . For example , they might use the app to set medication reminders or access tools for managing stress , anxiety , or sleep problems . Some software can use additional equipment to track heart rate , breathing patterns , blood pressure , and so forth to help people monitor their progress and receive feedback . Improve thinking skills Cognitive remediation apps help people improve their thinking skills . These apps are often designed for people with serious mental illnesses who may have distorted or unhelpful ways of thinking or hold inaccurate beliefs . Skill training Skill training apps may feel more like games than other mental health apps as they help people learn new coping or thinking skills . These apps might involve watching an educational video about anxiety management or the importance of social support , for example . People then pick new strategies to try and use the app to track how often they practice those new skills . Illness management and supported care Illness management and supported care apps provide additional support by allowing people to interact with another person . The app may connect people with peer support or send information to a trained health care provider who can offer guidance and therapy options . Researchers are working to learn how much human interaction people need for app-based treatments to be effective . Passive symptom tracking Symptom tracking apps collect data using the sensors built into smartphones . The sensors might record movement patterns , social interactions (such as the number of texts and phone calls), behavior at different times of day , vocal tone and speed , and more . In the future , apps may be able to analyze these data to determine a person s real-time state of mind . Such apps may also recognize changes in behavior patterns that signal an episode of mania , depression , or psychosis before it occurs . Although an app may not replace a mental health professional , it can alert caregivers when someone needs additional help . The goal is to create apps that support a range of people , including those with serious mental illnesses . Data collection Data collection apps gather data without any help from the person using them . Receiving widescale information from many people at the same time can increase researchers understanding of mental health and help them develop better interventions . Conducting research Apps can help conduct research . For example , Dr . Patricia Areán s pioneering BRIGTHEN study showed that research via a smartphone app is a reality . The BRIGHTEN study was remarkable because it used technology to both deliver treatment and conduct research . In other words , the research team used technology to recruit , screen , enroll , treat , and assess participants . BRIGHTEN was especially exciting because the study showed that technology can be an efficient way to test promising new treatments , while also highlighting the need to make those treatments engaging . If you or someone you know is struggling or having thoughts of suicide , call or text the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 or chat at 988lifeline . org . In life-threatening situations , call 911 . Who creates mental health apps ? Developing mental health apps and other technology requires a partnership between mental health professionals and software engineers . Researchers have found that interventions are most effective when people like them , are engaged in them , and want to continue using them . Behavioral health apps work best when they combine engineers skills for making an app easy to use and entertaining with providers skills for providing effective treatment options . Researchers and engineers are developing and testing apps that do everything from manage medications to teach coping skills to predict when someone may need emotional help . Who evaluates mental health apps ? There are no review boards , checklists , or widely accepted rules for evaluating or choosing a mental health app or other technology . Most apps do not have peer-reviewed research to support their claims , and it is unlikely that every mental health app will go through a randomized clinical research trial to test its effectiveness . One reason is that testing is a slow process , and technology evolves quickly . By the time an app has been put through rigorous scientific testing , the original technology may be outdated . Currently , there are no national standards for evaluating the effectiveness of the hundreds of available mental health apps . People should be cautious about trusting an app . However , there are a few suggestions for finding an app that may work for you : Ask a trusted health care provider for a recommendation . Some larger providers may offer several apps and collect data on their use . Check to see if the app offers recommendations for what to do if symptoms get worse or there is a psychiatric emergency . Know how to get help if needed . Decide if you want an app that is completely automated versus an app that offers opportunities for contact with a trained professional . Search for information on the app developer , including their credentials and experience . Beware of misleading logos . The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has not developed and does not endorse any apps . However , some app developers have unlawfully used the NIMH logo to market their products . Search the PubMed database offered by the National Library of Medicine . This resource contains articles on a wide range of research topics , including mental health app development . If you cannot find information about a particular app , check to see if the app is based on a treatment that has been tested . For example , research has shown that internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is as effective as conventional CBT for disorders that include depression , anxiety , social anxiety disorder , and panic disorder . Try it . If you re interested in an app , test it for a few days and decide if it s easy to use , holds your attention , and is something you want to continue using . An app is only effective if it keeps you engaged . What is NIMH s role in research on mental health intervention technology ? NIMH has awarded over 400 grants for technology-enhanced mental health interventions . NIMH staff continue to actively review and evaluate research grants related to mental health technology . These grants have focused on many areas , including : Feasibility , efficacy , and effectiveness research , such as developing and refining new treatments and interventions Technology for addressing a wide range of mental disorders , such as schizophrenia , HIV , depression , anxiety , autism , suicide , eating disorders , and trauma Interventions for cognitive issues , illness management , problematic behavior , and health communication More accessible and engaging ways to deliver therapies or skill development (for example , interactive formats or game-like approaches) and apps that work on any device Incorporating real-time , face-to-face contact or remote counseling (phone or online) with peers and professionals to provide a balance between technology and human touch Active and passive mobile assessment and monitoring Artificial intelligence (AI) tools and technologies A significant portion of NIMH funding for these types of technologies is through the NIMH Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Programs . In addition , NIMH created the National Advisory Mental Health Council workgroup on Opportunities and Challenges of Developing Information Technologies on Behavioral and Social Science Clinical Research to track and guide this rapidly changing area . In 2017, the workgroup released a report reviewing the opportunities for and challenges of using new information technologies to study human behaviors relevant to the NIMH mission . NIMH voiced its interest in this research area in a 2022 notice of special interest . The notice called for research on the utility and validity of digital health and AI tools and technologies in epidemiological , clinical , and intervention research . How can I find a clinical trial on mental health intervention technology ? Clinical trials are research studies that look at new ways to prevent , detect , or treat diseases and conditions . The goal of a clinical trial is to determine if a new test or treatment works and is safe . Although people may benefit from being part of a clinical trial , they should know that the primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gain new scientific knowledge so that others may be better helped in the future . Researchers at NIMH and around the country conduct many studies with patients and healthy volunteers . We have new and better treatment options today because of what clinical trials have uncovered . Be part of tomorrow s medical breakthroughs . Talk to a health care provider about clinical trials , their benefits and risks , and whether one is right for you .
