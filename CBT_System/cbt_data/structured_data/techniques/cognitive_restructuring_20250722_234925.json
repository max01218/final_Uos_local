An average course of treatment lasts around 10 treatment sessions (although this may be longer in the case of eating disorders) and sessions tend to be scheduled once a week . Cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) is the primary psychological treatment offered at our service , as there is a robust evidence-base to support the effectiveness of this intervention for a broad range of mental health problems . CBT can teach you strategies to modify unhelpful thoughts (cognitions) and behaviours . To learn more about CBT , we recommend reading this article by CCI Senior Clinical Psychologist Dr Peter McEvoy . Our treatments are delivered by clinical psychologists who have specialist , postgraduate university training in psychological assessment and therapy . Our team has years of experience treating depression , bipolar , anxiety , and eating disorders . We are passionate about making treatments that have been shown to be effective in scientific research freely available to the public at our clinic in Perth .

For the past two decades our service has been at the forefront of improving psychological treatments for mental disorders . For example , we were the first clinic in the world to be trained in enhanced Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT-E) for eating disorders , developed at Oxford University . We have also developed enhancements for CBT for social anxiety at our clinic that have now been proven to help more people overcome their social anxiety , when compared to standard treatments .
