Elements of psychotherapy can include the following: Help a person become aware of automatic ways of thinking that are inaccurate or harmful (for example, having a low opinion of their abilities) and then question those thoughts, understand how the thoughts affectheir emotions and behavior, and change self-defeating behavior patterns. This approach is known as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) . Identify ways to cope with stress andeveloproblem-solving strategies. Examine interactions with others and teach social and communication skills. Apply mindfulness and relaxation techniques, such as meditation and breathing exercises. Usexposure therapy (a type of CBT) for anxiety disorders, in which a person spends brief periods in a supportivenvironment learning tolerate the distress caused by certain items, ideas, or imagined scenes. This continued until, over time, the fear associated withose things goes down. Track emotions and behaviors to raise awareness of their impact on each other. Use supportive counseling to explore troubling issues and receivemotional support. Create a safety plan to help withoughts of self-harm or suicide, recognize warning signs, and use coping strategies, such as contacting friends, family, or emergency personnel.
