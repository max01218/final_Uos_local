There is evidence of significant inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms prior to age 12, typically by early to mid-childhood, though some individuals may first come to clinical attention later. The degree of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity is outside the limits of normal variation expected for age and level of intellectual functioning. Inattention refers to significant difficulty in sustaining attention to tasks that do not provide a high level of stimulation or frequent rewards, distractibility and problems with organisation. Hyperactivity refers to excessive motor activity and difficulties with remaining still, most evident in structured situations that require behavioural self-control. Impulsivity is a tendency to act in response to immediate stimuli, without deliberation or consideration of the risks and consequences.

Examples of opioids include morphine, diacetylmorphine (heroin), fentanyl, pethidine, oxycodone, hydromorphone, methadone, buprenorphine, codeine and d-propoxyphene. The opioids all have analgesic properties of different potencies and are primarily central nervous system depressants. They suppress respiration as well as other vital functions and are a common cause of overdose and related deaths. Certain opioids are used or administered parenterally, including heroin, a common and potent opioid that is primarily used non-medically. Therapeutic opioids are prescribed for a range of indications worldwide, and are essential for pain management in cancer pain and palliative care, although they are also used for non-therapeutic reasons. In some countries morbidity and mortality related to therapeutic opioids is greater than that related to heroin.

1. impaired control over gambling (e.g., onset, frequency, intensity, duration, termination, context);

2. increasing priority given to gambling to the extent that gambling takes precedence over other life interests and daily activities; and

Dissociative drugs include ketamine and phencyclidine (PCP) and their (comparatively rare) chemical analogues. Ketamine is an intravenous anaesthetic widely used in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Africa, and in emergency situations. Ketamine is also undergoing evaluation for treatment of some mental disorders (e.g., treatment resistant Depressive Disorders). It is also a widespread drug of nonmedical use in many countries and may be taken by the oral or nasal routes or injected. It produces a sense of euphoria but depending on the dose, emergent hallucinations and dissociation are recognised as unpleasant side effects. Phencyclidine has a more restricted worldwide distribution and also has euphoric and dissociative effects. Its use may result in bizarre behaviour uncharacteristic for the individual, including self-harm. Dissociative Drug Dependence is described but a withdrawal syndrome is not recognized by most authorities.

1676588433,Disorders due to use of alcohol,"Disorders due to use of alcohol are characterised by the pattern and consequences of alcohol use. Alcohol—more specifically termed ethyl alcohol or ethanol—is an intoxicating compound produced by fermentation of sugars usually in agricultural products such as fruits, cereals, and vegetables with or without subsequent distillation. There are a wide variety of alcoholic drinks, with alcohol concentrations typically ranging from 1.5% to 60%. Alcohol is predominantly a central nervous system depressant. In addition to ability to produce Alcohol Intoxication, alcohol has dependence-producing properties, resulting in Alcohol Dependence in some people and Alcohol Withdrawal when alcohol use is reduced or discontinued. Unlike most other substances, elimination of alcohol from the body occurs at a constant rate, such that its clearance follows a linear rather than a logarithmic course. Alcohol is implicated in a wide range of harms affecting most organs and systems of the body (e.g., cirrhosis of the liver, gastrointestinal cancers, pancreatitis). Harm to others resulting from behaviour during Alcohol Intoxication is well recognized and is included in the definitions of harmful use of alcohol (i.e., Episode of Harmful Use of Alcohol and Harmful Pattern of Use of Alcohol).

The characteristic feature is a strong internal drive to use synthetic cathinones, which is manifested by impaired ability to control use, increasing priority given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite harm or negative consequences. These experiences are often accompanied by a subjective sensation of urge or craving to use synthetic cathinones. Physiological features of dependence may also be present, including tolerance to the effects of synthetic cathinones, withdrawal symptoms following cessation or reduction in use of synthetic cathinones, or repeated use of synthetic cathinones or pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or alleviate withdrawal symptoms. The features of dependence are usually evident over a period of at least 12 months but the diagnosis may be made if synthetic cathinone use is continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 3 months.",,category,,Harmful pattern of use of synthetic cathinones|Episode of harmful use of synthetic cathinones

They may also have motor impairments and typically require daily support in a supervised environment for adequate care, but may acquire basic self-care skills with intensive training.

The features of dependence are usually evident over a period of at least 12 months but the diagnosis may be made if MDMA or related drug use is continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 3 months.",,category,,"Episode of harmful use of MDMA or related drugs, including MDA|Harmful pattern of use of MDMA or related drugs, including MDA"
