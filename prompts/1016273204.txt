Disorder Name: Disorders due to use of stimulants including amphetamines, methamphetamine or methcathinone
Disorder Code: 1016273204
Code Range: Not specified
Class Kind: category

Standard Definition:
Disorders due to use of stimulants including amphetamines, methamphetamine or methcathinone are characterised by the pattern and consequences of use of these substances. There is a wide array of naturally occurring and synthetically produced psychostimulants other than cocaine. The most numerous of this group are the amphetamine-type substances, including methamphetamine. Prescribed stimulants including dexamphetamine are indicated for a limited number of conditions such as for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Methcathinone, known in many countries as ephedrone, is a synthetic potent stimulant that is a structural analogue of methamphetamine and is related to cathinone. All these drugs have primarily psychostimulant properties and are also vasoconstrictors to a varying degree. They induce euphoria and hyperactivity as may be seen in Stimulant Intoxication. They have potent dependence-producing properties, which may lead to the diagnosis of Stimulant Dependence and Stimulant Withdrawal following the cessation of use. Several Stimulant-Induced Mental Disorders are described.

Exclusions: Disorders due to use of synthetic cathinones; Disorders due to use of caffeine; Disorders due to use of cocaine; Hazardous use of stimulants including amphetamines or methamphetamine
