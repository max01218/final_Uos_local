Disorder Name: Schizoaffective disorder
Disorder Code: 106339515
Code Range: Not specified
Class Kind: category

Standard Definition:
Schizoaffective disorder is an episodic disorder in which the diagnostic requirements of schizophrenia and a manic, mixed, or moderate or severe depressive episode are met within the same episode of illness, either simultaneously or within a few days of each other. Prominent symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g. delusions, hallucinations, disorganisation in the form of thought, experiences of influence, passivity and control) are accompanied by typical symptoms of a moderate or severe depressive episode (e.g. depressed mood, loss of interest, reduced energy), a manic episode (e.g. an extreme mood state characterised by euphoria, irritability, or expansiveness; increased activity or a subjective experience of increased energy) or a mixed episode. Psychomotor disturbances, including catatonia, may be present. Symptoms must have persisted for at least one month. The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a brain tumor) and are not due to the effect of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g. corticosteroids), including withdrawal (e.g. alcohol withdrawal).

• Develop individualized treatment plans
• Consider evidence-based treatment approaches
• Refer to specialist treatment when necessary
• Regular monitoring of treatment progress and plan adjustments
