Standard Definition:
Opioid dependence is a disorder of regulation of opioid use arising from repeated or continuous use of opioids.

These experiences are often accompanied by a subjective sensation of urge or craving to use opioids. Physiological features of dependence may also be present, including tolerance to the effects of opioids, withdrawal symptoms following cessation or reduction in use of opioids, or repeated use of opioids or pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or alleviate withdrawal symptoms. The features of dependence are usually evident over a period of at least 12 months but the diagnosis may be made if opioid use is continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 3 months.
