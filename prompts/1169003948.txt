Standard Definition:
Developmental language disorder with impairment of mainly expressive language is characterised by persistent difficulties in the acquisition, production, and use of language that arise during the developmental period, typically during early childhood, and cause significant limitations in the individual’s ability to communicate.

Inclusions: Developmental dysphasia or aphasia, expressive type
Exclusions: acquired aphasia with epilepsy [Landau-Kleffner]; Selective mutism; dysphasia and aphasia: developmental, receptive type; dysphasia NOS; aphasia NOS; Diseases of the nervous system; Deafness not otherwise specified
