Disorder Code: 1173624218
Code Range: Not specified

Standard Definition:
Dementia due to human immunodeficiency virus develops during the course of confirmed HIV disease, in the absence of a concurrent illness or condition other than HIV infection that could explain the clinical features. Although a variety of patterns of cognitive deficit are possible depending on where the HIV pathogenic processes have occurred, typically deficits follow a subcortical pattern with impairments in executive function, processing speed, attention, and learning new information. The course of Dementia due to human immunodeficiency virus varies including resolution of symptoms, gradual decline in functioning, improvement, or fluctuation in symptoms. Rapid decline in cognitive functioning is rare with the advent of antiretroviral medications.
