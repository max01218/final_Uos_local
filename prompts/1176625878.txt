Disorder Name: Cocaine-induced anxiety disorder
Disorder Code: 1176625878
Code Range: Not specified
Class Kind: category

Standard Definition:
Cocaine-induced anxiety disorder is characterised by anxiety symptoms (e.g., apprehension or worry, fear, physiological symptoms of excessive autonomic arousal, avoidance behaviour) that develop during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from cocaine. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of anxiety symptoms that are characteristic of Cocaine intoxication or Cocaine withdrawal. The amount and duration of cocaine use must be capable of producing anxiety symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., an Anxiety and fear-related disorder, a Depressive disorder with prominent anxiety symptoms), as might be the case if the anxiety symptoms preceded the onset of the cocaine use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the cocaine use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with anxiety symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with cocaine use).

• Recommend use of standardized assessment tools and diagnostic criteria

Treatment Considerations:
• Develop individualized treatment plans
• Consider evidence-based treatment approaches
• Refer to specialist treatment when necessary
