Standard Definition:
Obsessive-compulsive or related disorder induced by unknown or unspecified psychoactive substance is characterised by either repetitive intrusive thoughts or preoccupations, normally associated with anxiety and typically accompanied by repetitive behaviours performed in response, or by recurrent and habitual actions directed at the integument (e.g., hair pulling, skin picking) that develop during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from an unknown or unspecified psychoactive substance. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (in particular an Obsessive-compulsive or related disorder), as might be the case if the symptoms preceded the onset of the unknown or unspecified psychoactive substance use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of use or withdrawal of the unknown or unspecified psychoactive substance, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with obsessive-compulsive or related symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with the unknown or unspecified psychoactive substance use).
