Disorder Name: Psychotic disorder induced by multiple specified psychoactive substances
Disorder Code: 1183869990
Code Range: Not specified
Class Kind: category

Standard Definition:
Psychotic disorder induced by multiple specified psychoactive substances is characterised by psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions, hallucinations, disorganised thinking, grossly disorganised behaviour) that develop during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from multiple specified psychoactive substances. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of psychotic-like disturbances of perception, cognition, or behaviour that are characteristic of intoxication with or withdrawal from multiple specified psychoactive substances. The amount and duration of use of the multiple specified psychoactive substances must be capable of producing psychotic symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia, a Mood disorder with psychotic symptoms), as might be the case if the psychotic symptoms preceded the onset of the use of the multiple specified psychoactive substances, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the use of the multiple specified psychoactive substances or withdrawal from the multiple specified psychoactive substances, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with psychotic symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with the use of the multiple specified psychoactive substances).

Diagnostic Guidelines:
• Symptom assessment should be conducted within appropriate time frames
• Consider impact of symptoms on personal, family, social, and occupational functioning
• Evaluate symptom severity and duration
• Rule out symptoms due to substance use, medical conditions, or other psychological disorders
• Recommend use of standardized assessment tools and diagnostic criteria

Treatment Considerations:
• Develop individualized treatment plans
• Consider evidence-based treatment approaches
• Refer to specialist treatment when necessary
• Regular monitoring of treatment progress and plan adjustments
