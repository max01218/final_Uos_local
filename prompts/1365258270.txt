Disorder Name: Dementia due to cerebrovascular disease
Disorder Code: 1365258270
Code Range: Not specified
Class Kind: category

Standard Definition:
Dementia due to brain parenchyma injury resulting from cerebrovascular disease (ischemic or haemorrhagic). The onset of the cognitive deficits is temporally related to one or more vascular events. Cognitive decline is typically most prominent in speed of information processing, complex attention, and frontal-executive functioning. There is evidence of the presence of cerebrovascular disease considered to be sufficient to account for the neurocognitive deficits from history, physical examination and neuroimaging.

Exclusions: Alzheimer disease dementia, mixed type, with cerebrovascular disease
