Disorder Name: Opioid intoxication
Disorder Code: 1395283456
Code Range: Not specified
Class Kind: category

Standard Definition:
Opioid intoxication is a clinically significant transient condition that develops during or shortly after the consumption of opioids that is characterised by disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behaviour, or coordination. These disturbances are caused by the known pharmacological effects of opioids and their intensity is closely related to the amount of opioids consumed. They are time-limited and abate as opioids are cleared from the body. Presenting features may include somnolence, stupor, mood changes (e.g. euphoria followed by apathy and dysphoria), psychomotor retardation, impaired judgment, respiratory depression, slurred speech, and impairment of memory and attention. In severe intoxication coma may ensue. A characteristic physical sign is pupillary constriction but this sign may be absent when intoxication is due to synthetic opioids. Severe opioid intoxication can lead to death due to respiratory depression.

Exclusions: opioid poisoning; Possession trance disorder; fentanyl poisoning; oxycodone poisoning
