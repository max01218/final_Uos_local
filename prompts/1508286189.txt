Disorder Name: Disorder of intellectual development, severe
Disorder Code: 1508286189
Code Range: Not specified
Class Kind: category

Standard Definition:
A severe disorder of intellectual development is a condition originating during the developmental period characterised by significantly below average intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour that are approximately four or more standard deviations below the mean (less than approximately the 0.003rd percentile), based on appropriately normed, individually administered standardized tests or by comparable behavioural indicators when standardized testing is unavailable. Affected persons exhibit very limited language and capacity for acquisition of academic skills. They may also have motor impairments and typically require daily support in a supervised environment for adequate care, but may acquire basic self-care skills with intensive training. Severe and profound disorders of intellectual development are differentiated exclusively on the basis of adaptive behaviour differences because existing standardized tests of intelligence cannot reliably or validly distinguish among individuals with intellectual functioning below the 0.003rd percentile.

Diagnostic Guidelines:
• Symptom assessment should be conducted within appropriate time frames
• Consider impact of symptoms on personal, family, social, and occupational functioning
• Evaluate symptom severity and duration
• Rule out symptoms due to substance use, medical conditions, or other psychological disorders
• Recommend use of standardized assessment tools and diagnostic criteria

Treatment Considerations:
• Develop individualized treatment plans
• Consider evidence-based treatment approaches
• Refer to specialist treatment when necessary
• Regular monitoring of treatment progress and plan adjustments
