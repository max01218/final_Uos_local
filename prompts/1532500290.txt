Standard Definition:
Pyromania is characterised by a recurrent failure to control strong impulses to set fires, resulting in multiple acts of, or attempts at, setting fire to property or other objects, in the absence of an apparent motive (e.g., monetary gain, revenge, sabotage, political statement, attracting attention or recognition). There is an increasing sense of tension or affective arousal prior to instances of fire setting, persistent fascination or preoccupation with fire and related stimuli (e.g., watching fires, building fires, fascination with firefighting equipment), and a sense of pleasure, excitement, relief or gratification during, and immediately after the act of setting the fire, witnessing its effects, or participating in its aftermath. The behaviour is not better explained by intellectual impairment, another mental and behavioural disorder, or substance intoxication.

Inclusions: pathological fire-setting
Exclusions: Conduct-dissocial disorder; Bipolar type I disorder; Schizophrenia or other primary psychotic disorders; Fire-setting as the reason for observation for suspected mental or behavioural disorders, ruled out
