Disorder Name: MDMA or related drug-induced psychotic disorder, including MDA
Disorder Code: 1589999330
Code Range: Not specified
Class Kind: category

Standard Definition:
MDMA or related drug-induced psychotic disorder, including MDA is characterised by psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions, hallucinations, disorganised thinking, grossly disorganised behaviour) that develop during or soon after intoxication with MDMA or related drugs. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of psychotic-like disturbances of perception, cognition, or behaviour that are characteristic of MDMA or related drug intoxication. The amount and duration of MDMA or related drug use must be capable of producing psychotic symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia, a Mood disorder with psychotic symptoms), as might be the case if the psychotic symptoms preceded the onset of the MDMA or related drug use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the MDMA or related drug use, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with psychotic symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with MDMA or related drug use, including MDA).

• Rule out symptoms due to substance use, medical conditions, or other psychological disorders
• Recommend use of standardized assessment tools and diagnostic criteria

Treatment Considerations:
• Develop individualized treatment plans
• Consider evidence-based treatment approaches
• Refer to specialist treatment when necessary
• Regular monitoring of treatment progress and plan adjustments
