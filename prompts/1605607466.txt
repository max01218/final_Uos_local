Standard Definition:
Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic dependence is a disorder of regulation of sedative use arising from repeated or continuous use of these substances. The characteristic feature is a strong internal drive to use sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics, which is manifested by impaired ability to control use, increasing priority given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite harm or negative consequences. These experiences are often accompanied by a subjective sensation of urge or craving to use these substances. Physiological features of dependence may also be present, including tolerance to the effects of sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics, withdrawal symptoms following cessation or reduction in use, or repeated use of sedatives or pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or alleviate withdrawal symptoms. The features of dependence are usually evident over a period of at least 12 months but the diagnosis may be made if sedative use is continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 3 months.

Exclusions: Episode of harmful use of sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics; Harmful pattern of use of sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics
