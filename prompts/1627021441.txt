Disorder Name: Stimulant-induced anxiety disorder including amphetamines, methamphetamine or methcathinone
Disorder Code: 1627021441
Code Range: Not specified
Class Kind: category

Standard Definition:
Stimulant-induced anxiety disorder including amphetamines, methamphetamine and methcathinone is characterised by anxiety symptoms (e.g., apprehension or worry, fear, physiological symptoms of excessive autonomic arousal, avoidance behaviour) that develop during or soon after intoxication or withdrawal due to stimulants. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of anxiety symptoms that are characteristic of Stimulant intoxication or Stimulant withdrawal. The amount and duration of stimulant use must be capable of producing anxiety symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., an Anxiety and fear-related disorder, a Depressive disorder with prominent anxiety symptoms), as might be the case if the anxiety symptoms preceded the onset of the stimulant use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the stimulant use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with anxiety symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with use of stimulants).

Exclusions: Cocaine-induced anxiety disorder; Caffeine-induced anxiety disorder; Synthetic cathinone-induced anxiety disorder

Diagnostic Exclusion Criteria:
• Should be differentiated from: Cocaine-induced anxiety disorder
• Should be differentiated from: Caffeine-induced anxiety disorder
• Should be differentiated from: Synthetic cathinone-induced anxiety disorder

Diagnostic Guidelines:
• Symptom assessment should be conducted within appropriate time frames
• Consider impact of symptoms on personal, family, social, and occupational functioning
• Evaluate symptom severity and duration
• Rule out symptoms due to substance use, medical conditions, or other psychological disorders
• Recommend use of standardized assessment tools and diagnostic criteria

Treatment Considerations:
• Develop individualized treatment plans
• Consider evidence-based treatment approaches
• Refer to specialist treatment when necessary
