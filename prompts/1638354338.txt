Disorder Name: Secondary impulse control syndrome
Disorder Code: 1638354338
Code Range: Not specified
Class Kind: category

Standard Definition:
A syndrome characterised by the presence of prominent symptoms that are characteristic of Impulse Control Disorders or Disorders Due to Addictive Behaviours (e.g., stealing, fire-setting, aggressive outbursts, compulsive sexual behaviour, excessive gambling) that are judged to be a direct pathophysiological consequence of a health condition not classified under mental and behavioural disorders, based on evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. The symptoms are not accounted for by delirium or by another mental and behavioural disorder, and are not a psychologically mediated response to a severe medical condition (e.g., as part of an adjustment disorder in response to a life-threatening diagnosis). This category should be used in addition to the diagnosis for the presumed underlying disorder or disease when the impulse control symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant specific clinical attention.

Exclusions: Delirium
