Standard Definition:
Disorders due to use of cocaine are characterised by the pattern and consequences of cocaine use. Cocaine is a compound found in the leaves of the coca plant, Erythroxylum coca, which is indigenous to countries in northern regions of South America. Cocaine has a limited place in medical treatment as an anaesthetic and vasoconstrictive agent. It is commonly used illicitly and widely available across the world, where it is found in two main forms: cocaine hydrochloride and cocaine freebase (also known as ‘crack’). Cocaine is a central nervous system stimulant, and Cocaine Intoxication typically includes a state of euphoria and hyperactivity. Cocaine has potent dependence-producing properties and Cocaine Dependence is a common cause of morbidity and of clinical presentations. Cocaine Withdrawal has a characteristic course that includes lethargy and depressed mood. A range of Cocaine-Induced Mental Disorders is described.
