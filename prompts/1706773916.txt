Standard Definition:
Bipolar type I disorder, current episode mixed, without psychotic symptoms is diagnosed when the definitional requirements for Bipolar type I disorder are met and the current episode is mixed and there are no delusions or hallucinations present during the episode. A mixed episode is characterised by the presence of several prominent manic and several prominent depressive symptoms consistent with those observed in manic episodes and depressive episodes, which either occur simultaneously or alternate very rapidly (from day to day or within the same day). Symptoms must include an altered mood state consistent with a manic and/or depressive episode (i.e., depressed, dysphoric, euphoric or expansive mood), and be present most of the day, nearly every day, during a period of at least 2 weeks, unless shortened by a treatment intervention. If the individual has experienced Manic or Mixed Episodes in the past, a duration of 2 weeks is not required in order to diagnose a current episode if all other diagnostic requirements are met.
