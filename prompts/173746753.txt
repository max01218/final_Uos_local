Disorder Name: Hallucinogen-induced psychotic disorder
Disorder Code: 173746753
Code Range: Not specified
Class Kind: category

Standard Definition:
Hallucinogen-induced psychotic disorder is characterised by psychotic symptoms (e.g. delusions, hallucinations, disorganised thinking, grossly disorganised behaviour) that develop during or soon after intoxication with hallucinogens. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of psychotic-like disturbances of perception, cognition, or behaviour that are characteristic of hallucinogen intoxication. The amount and duration of hallucinogen use must be capable of producing psychotic symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g. Schizophrenia, a Mood disorder with psychotic symptoms), as might be the case if the psychotic symptoms preceded the onset of the hallucinogen use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the hallucinogen use, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with psychotic symptoms (e.g. a history of prior episodes not associated with hallucinogen use).

Exclusions: Psychotic disorder induced by other specified psychoactive substance; Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder
