Disorder Name: Stimulant-induced obsessive-compulsive or related disorder including amphetamines, methamphetamine or methcathinone
Disorder Code: 1830469239
Code Range: Not specified
Class Kind: category

Standard Definition:
Stimulant-induced obsessive-compulsive or related disorder including amphetamines, methamphetamine and methcathinone is characterised by either repetitive intrusive thoughts or preoccupations, normally associated with anxiety and typically accompanied by repetitive behaviours performed in response, or by recurrent and habitual actions directed at the integument (e.g., hair pulling, skin picking) that develop during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from stimulants. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of analogous disturbances that are characteristic of Stimulant intoxication or Stimulant withdrawal. The amount and duration of stimulant use must be capable of producing obsessive-compulsive or related symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (in particular an Obsessive-compulsive or related disorder), as might be the case if the symptoms preceded the onset of the stimulant use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the stimulant use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with obsessive-compulsive or related symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with stimulant use).

Exclusions: Cocaine-induced obsessive-compulsive or related disorder; Synthetic cathinone-induced obsessive-compulsive or related syndrome; Disorders due to use of caffeine
