Disorder Name: Disorders due to use of hallucinogens
Disorder Code: 1967909777
Code Range: Not specified
Class Kind: category

Standard Definition:
Disorders due to use of hallucinogens are characterised by the pattern and consequences of hallucinogen use. Several thousand compounds have hallucinogenic properties, many of which are found in plants (e.g., mescaline) and fungi (e.g., psilocybin) or are chemically synthesized (e.g., lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD]). These compounds have primarily hallucinogenic properties, but some may also be stimulants. Much of the morbidity associated with these compounds arises from the acute effects related to Hallucinogen Intoxication. Hallucinogen Dependence is rare and Hallucinogen Withdrawal is not described. Among the mental disorders related to hallucinogen use, Hallucinogen-Induced Psychotic Disorder is the most frequently seen, although worldwide it is still fairly uncommon.
