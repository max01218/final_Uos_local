Disorder Name: Stimulant-induced psychotic disorder including amphetamines, methamphetamine or methcathinone
Disorder Code: 199002751
Code Range: Not specified
Class Kind: category

Standard Definition:
Stimulant-induced psychotic disorder including amphetamines, methamphetamine and methcathinone is characterised by psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions, hallucinations, disorganised thinking, grossly disorganised behaviour) that develop during or soon after intoxication or withdrawal due to stimulants. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of psychotic-like disturbances of perception, cognition, or behaviour that are characteristic of Stimulant intoxication or Stimulant withdrawal. The amount and duration of stimulant use must be capable of producing psychotic symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia, a Mood disorder with psychotic symptoms), as might be the case if the psychotic symptoms preceded the onset of the stimulant use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the stimulant use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with psychotic symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with use of stimulants).

Exclusions: Cocaine-induced psychotic disorder; Synthetic cathinone-induced psychotic disorder; Disorders due to use of caffeine
