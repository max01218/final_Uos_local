Disorder Name: Depersonalization-derealization disorder
Disorder Code: 253124068
Code Range: Not specified
Class Kind: category

Standard Definition:
Depersonalization-derealization disorder is characterised by persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Depersonalization is characterised by experiencing the self as strange or unreal, or feeling detached from, or as though one were an outside observer of, one’s thoughts, feelings, sensations, body, or actions. Derealization is characterised by experiencing other persons, objects, or the world as strange or unreal (e.g., dreamlike, distant, foggy, lifeless, colourless, or visually distorted) or feeling detached from one’s surroundings. During experiences of depersonalization or derealization, reality testing remains intact. The experiences of depersonalization or derealization do not occur exclusively during another dissociative disorder and are not better explained by another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder. The experiences of depersonalization or derealization are not due to the direct effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including withdrawal effects, and are not due to a disease of the nervous system or to head trauma. The symptoms result in significant distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.
