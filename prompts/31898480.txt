It is the most commonly used psychoactive substance worldwide and several clinical conditions related to its use are described, although severe disorders are comparatively rare considering its ubiquity. Caffeine Intoxication related to consumption of relatively higher doses (i.e., > 1 g per day) is described. Caffeine Withdrawal is common upon cessation of use among individuals who have used caffeine for a prolonged period or in large amounts. Caffeine-Induced Anxiety Disorder has been described, often following intoxication or heavy use.
