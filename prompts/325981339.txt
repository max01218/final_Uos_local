Disorder Name: MDMA or related drug-induced anxiety disorder
Disorder Code: 325981339
Code Range: Not specified
Class Kind: category

Standard Definition:
MDMA or related drug-induced anxiety disorder, including MDA is characterised by anxiety symptoms (e.g., apprehension or worry, fear, physiological symptoms of excessive autonomic arousal, avoidance behaviour) that develop during or soon after intoxication with MDMA or related drugs. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of anxiety symptoms that are characteristic of MDMA or related drug intoxication, including MDA. The amount and duration of MDMA or related drug use must be capable of producing anxiety symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., an Anxiety and fear-related disorder, a Depressive disorder with prominent anxiety symptoms), as might be the case if the anxiety symptoms preceded the onset of the MDMA or related drug use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the MDMA or related drug use, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with anxiety symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with MDMA or related drug use).

• Rule out symptoms due to substance use, medical conditions, or other psychological disorders
• Recommend use of standardized assessment tools and diagnostic criteria

Treatment Considerations:
• Develop individualized treatment plans
• Consider evidence-based treatment approaches
• Refer to specialist treatment when necessary
• Regular monitoring of treatment progress and plan adjustments
