Standard Definition:
Manic mood symptoms in primary psychotic disorders refer to elevated, euphoric, irritable, or expansive mood states, including rapid changes among different mood states (i.e., mood lability). It also includes increased subjective experience of energy, which may be accompanied by increased goal-directed activity. The severity of associated non-mood symptoms of a Manic or Hypomanic Episode (e.g., decreased need for sleep, distractibility) should not be considered in making a rating. Increased non-goal-directed psychomotor activity should be considered as part of the rating of the 'psychomotor symptoms in primary psychotic disorders' rather than here. This descriptor may be used whether or not the manic symptoms meet the diagnostic requirements of a separately diagnosed bipolar disorder. The rating should be made based on the severity of manic mood symptoms during the past week.
