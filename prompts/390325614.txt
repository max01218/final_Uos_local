Disorder Code: 390325614
Code Range: Not specified
Class Kind: category

Standard Definition:
Disorders due to use of sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics are characterised by the pattern and consequences of use of these substances. Sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics are typically prescribed for the short-term treatment of anxiety or insomnia and are also employed to provide sedation for medical procedures. They include the benzodiazepines and the non-benzodiazepine positive allosteric modulators of GABA receptors (i.e., ‘Z-drugs’) as well as many other compounds. Sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics include barbiturates, which are available much less commonly now than in previous decades. Sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics have dependence-inducing properties that are related to the dose and duration of their use. They may cause intoxication, dependence and withdrawal. Several other mental disorders induced by sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics are recognized.

Exclusions: Hazardous use of sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics
