Disorder Code: 694002628
Code Range: Not specified
Class Kind: category

Standard Definition:
Dementia due to use of volatile inhalants is characterised by the development of persistent cognitive impairments (e.g., memory problems, language impairment, and an inability to perform complex motor tasks) that meet the definitional requirements of Dementia that are judged to be a direct consequence of inhalant use or exposure and that persist beyond the usual duration of action or withdrawal syndrome associated with the substance. The amount and duration of inhalant use or exposure must be sufficient to be capable of producing the cognitive impairment. The cognitive impairment is not better accounted for by a disorder that is not induced by volatile inhalants such as a dementia due to another medical condition.
