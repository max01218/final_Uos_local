Disorder Name: Stimulant-induced mood disorder including amphetamines, methamphetamine or methcathinone
Disorder Code: 724783925
Code Range: Not specified
Class Kind: category

Standard Definition:
Stimulant-induced mood disorder including amphetamines, methamphetamine and methcathinone is characterised by mood symptoms (e.g., depressed or elevated mood, decreased engagement in pleasurable activities, increased or decreased energy levels) that develop during or soon after intoxication or withdrawal due to stimulants. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of mood disturbances that are characteristic of Stimulant intoxication or Stimulant withdrawal. The amount and duration of stimulant use must be capable of producing mood symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., a Depressive disorder, a Bipolar disorder, Schizoaffective disorder), as might be the case if the mood symptoms preceded the onset of the stimulant use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the stimulant use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with mood symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with use of stimulants).

Exclusions: Synthetic cathinone-induced mood disorder; Cocaine-induced mood disorder; Disorders due to use of caffeine
