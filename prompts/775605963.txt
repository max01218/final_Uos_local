Standard Definition:
Factitious disorder imposed on another is characterised by feigning, falsifying, or inducing medical, psychological, or behavioural signs and symptoms or injury in another person, most commonly a child dependent, associated with identified deception. If a pre-existing disorder or disease is present in the other person, the individual intentionally aggravates existing symptoms or falsifies or induces additional symptoms. The individual seeks treatment for the other person or otherwise presents him or her as ill, injured, or impaired based on the feigned, falsified, or induced signs, symptoms, or injuries. The deceptive behaviour is not solely motivated by obvious external rewards or incentives (e.g., obtaining disability payments or avoiding criminal prosecution for child or elder abuse).
