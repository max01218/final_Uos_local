Disorder Name: Factitious disorder imposed on self
Disorder Code: 790764418
Code Range: Not specified
Class Kind: category

Standard Definition:
Factitious disorder imposed on self is characterised by feigning, falsifying, or inducing medical, psychological, or behavioural signs and symptoms or injury associated with identified deception. If a pre-existing disorder or disease is present, the individual intentionally aggravates existing symptoms or falsifies or induces additional symptoms. The individual seeks treatment or otherwise presents himself or herself as ill, injured, or impaired based on the feigned, falsified, or self-induced signs, symptoms, or injuries. The deceptive behaviour is not solely motivated by obvious external rewards or incentives (e.g., obtaining disability payments or evading criminal prosecution). This is in contrast to Malingering, in which obvious external rewards or incentives motivate the behaviour

Inclusions: Münchhausen syndrome
Exclusions: Excoriation disorder; Malingering
