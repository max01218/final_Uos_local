Disorder Name: Synthetic cannabinoid-induced mood disorder
Disorder Code: 925940030
Code Range: Not specified
Class Kind: category

Standard Definition:
Synthetic cannabinoid-induced mood disorder is characterised by mood symptoms (e.g., depressed or elevated mood, decreased engagement in pleasurable activities, increased or decreased energy levels) that develop during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from synthetic cannabinoids. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of mood disturbances that are characteristic of Synthetic cannabinoid intoxication or Synthetic cannabinoid withdrawal. The amount and duration of synthetic cannabinoid use must be capable of producing mood symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., a Depressive disorder, a Bipolar disorder, Schizoaffective disorder), as might be the case if the mood symptoms preceded the onset of the synthetic cannabinoid use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the synthetic cannabinoid use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with mood symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with synthetic cannabinoid use).

Diagnostic Guidelines:
• Symptom assessment should be conducted within appropriate time frames
• Consider impact of symptoms on personal, family, social, and occupational functioning
• Evaluate symptom severity and duration
• Rule out symptoms due to substance use, medical conditions, or other psychological disorders
• Recommend use of standardized assessment tools and diagnostic criteria

Treatment Considerations:
• Develop individualized treatment plans
• Consider evidence-based treatment approaches
• Refer to specialist treatment when necessary
• Regular monitoring of treatment progress and plan adjustments
