Disorder Name: Amnestic disorder due to other specified psychoactive substance including medications
Disorder Code: 973846324
Code Range: Not specified
Class Kind: category

Standard Definition:
All definitional requirements for amnestic disorder are met. The memory symptoms are judged to be the direct consequence of use of a specified psychoactive substance other than alcohol; sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics; or volatile inhalants. The intensity and duration of use of the specified psychoactive substance must be known to be capable of producing memory impairment. The memory impairment may develop during or soon after specified psychoactive substance intoxication or withdrawal, but its intensity and duration are substantially in excess of those normally associated with these conditions. The symptoms are not better accounted for by another disorder or medical condition, as might be the case if the amnestic symptoms preceded the onset of the specified psychoactive substance.
