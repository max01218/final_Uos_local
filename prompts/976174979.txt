Disorder Name: Volatile inhalant intoxication
Disorder Code: 976174979
Code Range: Not specified
Class Kind: category

Standard Definition:
Volatile inhalant intoxication is a clinically significant transient condition that develops during or shortly after the consumption of a volatile inhalant that is characterised by disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behaviour, or coordination. These disturbances are caused by the known pharmacological effects of volatile inhalants and their intensity is closely related to the amount of volatile inhalant consumed. They are time-limited and abate as the volatile inhalant is cleared from the body. Presenting features may include euphoria, impaired judgment, aggression, somnolence, stupor or coma, dizziness, tremor, lack of coordination, slurred speech, unsteady gait, lethargy and apathy, psychomotor retardation, and visual disturbances. Muscle weakness and diplopia may occur. Use of volatile inhalants may cause cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, and death. Inhalants containing lead (e.g. some forms of petrol/gasoline) may cause confusion, irritability, coma and seizures.

Exclusions: Possession trance disorder
